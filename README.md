**`Current Student of Computer Science and Data Science at Lewis & Clark College`**<br>
Hello! I'm Panagiotis Tsimpouris, an international student at Lewis & Clark College with a strong passion for programming and problem-solving. Growing up in an international community with peers from 72 countries gave me a global perspective, which enriches my approach to collaborative projects. At college, Iâ€™ve been honing my skills in programming, data structures, and algorithms, while also exploring the ethical implications of technology in society. My work reflects a growing proficiency in languages like C, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, R and a commitment to creating elegant, efficient, and impactful solutions. Iâ€™m excited to share my journey and projects with you hereâ€”feel free to explore my repositories and reach out for collaboration!
